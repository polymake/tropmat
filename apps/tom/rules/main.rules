# @topic application
# This application deals with __t__ropical __o__riented __m__atroids (toms) as defined by Ardila and Develin. TropicalOrientedMatroids are defined via their [[TYPES]] (or some subsets, such as its [[VERTICES]] or [[TOPES]]).
# 
# One can for instance check whether an object defined in this way does actually [[IS_TOM|satisfy the axioms]] of tropical oriented matroids. Moreover, one can perform simple transformation such as [[CONTRACTION]] and [[DELETION]]. For toms of [[DIM|dimension]] at most 3, there are also quite elaborate visualisation methods.
